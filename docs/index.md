## About
ecc is a small Python program to perform cell detection. It will identify the XYZ position, expression amount, and volume of the targeted cells from 3D mouse brain image. It is based on [ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/), a machine-learning framework to train pixel classifiers.

The detected cell list (given as csv format) can be further analyzed and visualized by using [CUBIC-Cloud](https://cubic-cloud-free.org) cloud computing service.
